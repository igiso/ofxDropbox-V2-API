# ofxDropbox-V2-API
This is an Addon for IOS and MAC based on the now deprecated https://github.com/trentbrooks/ofxDropBox

BY Trent Brooks (all credit to him)

this is basically the same thing updated to work with V2 api

You need to download , COMPILE and link the 

v2 Objective C API

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/objective-c

Follow this:

https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-obj-c#configure-your-project

If you are having issues when testing on Device instead of the simulator,
you need to compile the framework again for Device,

It's better to link your code into different projects , one for the device and one for the Simulator.

Mac Osx is easy.



I will upload an example soon.

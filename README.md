# ofxDropbox-V2-API
This is an Addon for IOS and MAC based on the now deprecated https://github.com/trentbrooks/ofxDropBox

It's basically the same thing updated to work with V2 api

You need to download COMPILE and link the 

v2 Objective C API

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/objective-c

Follow this:

https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-obj-c#configure-your-project

If you are having issues,
you need to compile the framework again for Device,

It's better to link your code into different projects , one for the device and one for the Simulator.

Mac Osx is easy.
